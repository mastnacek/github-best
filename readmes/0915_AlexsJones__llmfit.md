Find out which open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) your hardware can comfortably run. `llmfit` inspects your CPU, system RAM, GPU(s), VRAM, and accelerator configuration to recommend models across popular quantizations.

**📊 New: benchmark & share — real numbers from your machine, better estimates for everyone.** Download a model, serve it, and measure real tok/s on your hardware — then contribute the results back to the project as a PR, straight from the TUI. No `gh` CLI, no third-party account. Every run is saved locally first, your own measurements replace estimates in the fit table, and each merged submission ships in the next release: anyone on identical hardware gets measured `✓` numbers before they ever run a benchmark. [Follow the step-by-step benchmarking guide →](docs/benchmarking.md)

*Previously: [llmfit 1.0 — the release where the numbers became verifiable →](https://github.com/AlexsJones/llmfit/discussions/708)*

## Features

- **Hardware Auto-Detection**: Detects CPU cores, system RAM, available discrete/integrated GPUs, VRAM, and unified memory architecture (NVIDIA CUDA, Apple Silicon, AMD ROCm, Intel OneAPI).
- **Model Compatibility Engine**: Analyzes model parameter counts, context lengths, and quantization formats (GGUF, AWQ, GPTQ, EXL2) to project memory footprints and tokens-per-second performance.
- **Interactive TUI & Web Dashboard**: Choose between a lightweight, zero-dependency terminal interface or a feature-rich web dashboard.
- **REST API Endpoint**: Exposes standard HTTP JSON endpoints (`/api/v1/system`, `/api/v1/models`) for integration into orchestrators, dashboards, and automated deployment pipelines.
- **Multi-Platform Support**: macOS (Apple Silicon & Intel), Linux (x86_64 & ARM64), and Windows (x86_64).
- **Hundreds of models & providers. One command to find what runs on your hardware.**

A terminal tool that right-sizes LLM models to your system's RAM, CPU, and GPU. Detects your hardware, scores each model across quality, speed, fit, and context dimensions, and tells you which ones will actually run well on your machine.

Ships with an interactive TUI (default) and a classic CLI mode. Supports multi-GPU setups, MoE architectures, dynamic quantization selection, speed estimation, and local runtime providers (Ollama, llama.cpp, MLX, Docker Model Runner, LM Studio).

### Pre-built Binaries

Download signed release binaries for Linux, macOS, and Windows directly from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/AlexsJones/llmfit/releases) page.

---

## Container Deployment

`llmfit` provides a multi-architecture Docker image (`ghcr.io/alexsjones/llmfit`) supporting both interactive CLI/TUI and headless Web UI / API server modes.

### Interactive TUI

To launch the interactive TUI instead, pass the global `--tui` flag:

```sh
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/alexsjones/llmfit --tui
```

### Non-Interactive

This prints JSON from `llmfit recommend` command.

```sh
docker run ghcr.io/alexsjones/llmfit
```

This prints JSON from `llmfit recommend` command. The JSON could be further queried with `jq`.
```
podman run ghcr.io/alexsjones/llmfit recommend --use-case coding | jq '.models[].name'
```
To launch the interactive TUI instead, pass the global `--tui` flag:
```sh
docker run --rm -it ghcr.io/alexsjones/llmfit --tui
```

### From source
```sh
git clone https://github.com/AlexsJones/llmfit.git
cd llmfit
cargo build --release
# binary is at target/release/llmfit
```

---

## Usage

### Terminal Interface (TUI)

Launch `llmfit` in your terminal without flags to start the interactive browser:

```sh
llmfit          # interactive TUI: your hardware, every model, ranked
```

The TUI shows your detected specs at the top and every model scored for fit, speed, quality, and context. See the [TUI guide](docs/tui.md) for navigation, planning, simulation, downloads, the community leaderboard, and benchmarking.

Keybindings inside the TUI:
- `Tab` / `Shift+Tab`: Switch tabs (Models, System Info, Benchmark)
- `↑` / `↓` or `k` / `j`: Navigate list items
- `/`: Filter models by name, family, or quantization
- `Esc`: Clear search / Back

### Command Line Options

```sh
# Print hardware telemetry and recommended models to standard output
llmfit recommend

# Output system profile and recommendations in raw JSON format
llmfit recommend --json

# Start the native HTTP API server
llmfit serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8787
```

### Web UI & API Server

```sh
docker run -d -p 8787:8787 ghcr.io/alexsjones/llmfit serve
```

#### Docker Compose

```yaml
---
services:
  llmfit:
    image: ghcr.io/alexsjones/llmfit:latest
    container_name: llmfit
    restart: unless-stopped
    command: ["serve", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8787"]
    ports:
      - "8787:8787"
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8787/health"]
      interval: 15s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 10s
```

For scripts, agents, and classic terminal output:

```sh
llmfit fit                    # table of all models ranked by fit
llmfit recommend --json       # top picks as JSON (agent/script consumption)
llmfit info "<model>"         # one model: fit analysis, estimate basis, verify commands
llmfit bench                  # measure real tok/s/TTFT against your running provider
llmfit doctor                 # hardware detection report for bug reports
llmfit serve                  # start the api and web user interface
```

## Community & Benchmarks

`llmfit` includes hardware detection and performance benchmarks contributed by the community. You can share your hardware benchmark results using:

```sh
llmfit bench --share
```

---

## How it works

llmfit detects your hardware (RAM, CPU, GPU/VRAM, backend), then scores every model in its catalog across four dimensions: memory fit, estimated speed, quality, and context. Speed estimates come from a memory-bandwidth model grounded in runtime sampling and real community measurements — and every estimate ships its inputs, so `llmfit info` shows exactly what a number assumes and how to verify it on your machine.

Full detail, including the estimation formulas and the model database: [How llmfit works](docs/how-it-works.md).

---

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome, especially new models.

### Before submitting a PR

Please run `cargo fmt` before pushing your changes. Most CI check failures are caused by unformatted code:

```sh
cargo fmt
```

Guides for adding models — locally (no rebuild) or to the built-in catalog: [Custom models](docs/custom-models.md).

---

## Alternatives

If you're looking for a different approach, check out [llm-checker](https://github.com/Pavelevich/llm-checker) -- a Node.js CLI tool with Ollama integration that can pull and benchmark models directly. It takes a more hands-on approach by actually running models on your hardware via Ollama, rather than estimating from specs. Good if you already have Ollama installed and want to test real-world performance. Note that it doesn't support MoE (Mixture-of-Experts) architectures -- all models are treated as dense, so memory estimates for models like Mixtral or DeepSeek-V3 will reflect total parameter count rather than the smaller active subset.

---

## Code signing

llmfit's Windows release binaries are digitally signed (Authenticode) via [SignPath.io](https://about.signpath.io/), with a free code signing certificate provided by the [SignPath Foundation](https://signpath.org/).

Signing happens automatically in the [release pipeline](.github/workflows/release.yml): only artifacts built by GitHub Actions from this repository are submitted for signing, and signing requests are approved by the project maintainer ([@AlexsJones](https://github.com/AlexsJones)).

**Code signing policy:** see the [SignPath Foundation code signing policy and terms](https://signpath.org/terms).

**Privacy:** this program will not transfer any information to other networked systems unless specifically requested by the user or the person installing or operating it. llmfit only contacts external services when you explicitly use the corresponding feature (e.g. model downloads, runtime provider queries, or the community leaderboard).
